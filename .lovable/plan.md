## Certificate Gallery App

### Overview
A clean, minimal certificate display app where clicking the "Course Certificate" button navigates to a dedicated page showing your NPTEL certificate.

### Page 1: Home Page
- **Clean white background** with centered content
- **"Course Certificate" button** in blue (matching the NPTEL style from your screenshot)
- Simple, professional appearance with minimal distractions

---

### Page 2: Certificate View Page
- **Full-screen display** of your uploaded certificate image
- **Back button** to return to the home page
- Clean layout that lets your certificate be the focus

  - White/light gray backgrounds
